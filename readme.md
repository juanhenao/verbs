# Parabola


## About Parabola

Parabola is a php project developed with the Laravel framework and Bootstrap. The name comes from the latin term for word. Its purpose is to help with vocabulary when learning a new language as I believe in the importance of understanding each other.

It is intented to grow step by step as its a side project which I develop in my free time.

## Live Instance
